# GAN experiments

Objectives : 

- train a GAN to generate some MNIST digits
- train a GAN to generate larger colored images, why not cute pictures of cats 

## MNIST experiment

### Training the GAN

Below we display a collection of images generated by the generator during 400 epochs. After 50 epochs, you already get
reasonnably good images but I wanted to see what is going on in the long term.

For training, just run 

```
python3 main.py train
```

However, I'm really surprised by the losses and accuracies I get : a pretty low discriminator loss, a high discriminator accuracy and a high generator loss. All these metrics seem to indicate the generator is not doing a good job even if the generated digits are indeed, visually, reasonably good.

### Interpolation experiment

We take three random vectors. The image of the generator are the fake digits, on the picture below, in the top-left, top-right and bottom-left corners. Then, for every cell, we compute an interpolate random input of which we display the image by the generator.

For generating fake images, given a pretrained model :

```
python3 main.py generate --modelpath generator.pt
```
